      <h1>Chapter 6 - The Birth and Childhood of Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-23</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Now that the Kuru dynasty had heirs, the kingdom could breathe again. The three sons—Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura—grew up under the guidance of elders and sages, each displaying unique qualities that would shape the course of history.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Dhritarashtra – Strength in Darkness</strong></h2>
<p>Born blind, Dhritarashtra had immense physical strength and unmatched endurance. Despite his blindness, he trained hard and mastered various skills. However, his disability made him insecure and somewhat bitter.</p>
<p>Though loved by the elders, Dhritarashtra knew he would never be king. This knowledge quietly fermented into inner conflict—a struggle between love for family and the ambition he could never pursue.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Pandu – The Pale Prince</strong></h2>
<p>Pandu, although born pale and sickly, was sharp, brave, and energetic. He trained in warfare, archery, and leadership, becoming the most capable among the three brothers.</p>
<p>He was often sent on military expeditions and brought glory to the Kuru name, winning territories and spreading influence. His heroic qualities made him the natural choice for the next king.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Vidura – The Wise Counselor</strong></h2>
<p>Vidura, born of a maid but blessed with immense wisdom, became the royal minister. Though he couldn't claim the throne due to his birth, he was respected by all.</p>
<p>Vidura was known for his adherence to dharma and fairness. He studied the scriptures deeply and was always consulted on matters of governance. He would later become the moral compass during times of great confusion in the royal court.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Guru Kripacharya and Early Education</strong></h2>
<p>The princes were educated under <strong>Kripacharya</strong>, the royal teacher. He taught them martial arts, statecraft, ethics, and Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>The trio, despite their differences, shared a strong bond in childhood. However, deep within their hearts, each bore a different weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dhritarashtra felt denied.</li>
<li>Pandu felt responsible.</li>
<li>Vidura felt outside the circle.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Throne and Decisions</strong></h2>
<p>When it came time to crown the next king, the elders debated. Though Dhritarashtra was the eldest, his blindness disqualified him. Vidura, despite his wisdom, was not of royal birth.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>Pandu</strong> was crowned the new king of Hastinapura.</p>
<p>Dhritarashtra, though supportive on the surface, quietly resented the decision. Vidura, ever wise, accepted it with grace.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The seeds of future conflict were already sown—not through war, but through fate, inequality, and hidden pain. Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura were not just brothers—they were three paths shaped by destiny.</p>
<p>As their childhood ended, the stage was set for the rise of the next generation—the Pandavas and Kauravas.</p>
