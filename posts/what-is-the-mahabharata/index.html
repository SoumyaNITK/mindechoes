      <h1>What is the Mahabharata?</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-19</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The <em>Mahabharata</em> is not just a story.<br>
It is <strong>history, philosophy, devotion, emotion, drama</strong>, and <strong>life</strong> itself — all rolled into one.<br>
It’s one of the <strong>greatest epics ever written</strong> in the world.</p>
<p>The Mahabharata was written by <strong>Sage Vyasa</strong>, also known as <strong>Vedavyasa</strong>.<br>
It is said to have over <strong>100,000 verses</strong>, making it <strong>over 10 times longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey combined</strong>.</p>
<p>But more than its length, it is the <strong>depth</strong> that makes it so timeless.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🕉️ The Core of the Epic</h2>
<p>At the heart of the Mahabharata lies a <strong>family conflict</strong> between two groups of royal cousins:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Pandavas</strong> – Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva</li>
<li>The <strong>Kauravas</strong> – led by Duryodhana and his 99 brothers</li>
</ul>
<p>This conflict eventually leads to the <strong>Kurukshetra War</strong> — a massive war that changes everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🎓 What Does “Mahabharata” Mean?</h2>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Maha</strong>” = Great</li>
<li>“<strong>Bharata</strong>” = Refers to the Bharata dynasty</li>
</ul>
<p>So <em>Mahabharata</em> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The Great Story of the Bharata Dynasty.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s much more than the story of kings.<br>
It talks about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dharma (righteousness)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Karma (action)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moksha (liberation)</strong></li>
<li>And the eternal struggle between <strong>good and evil, truth and lies, love and hate</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📜 Who Wrote It?</h2>
<p>The author is <strong>Vyasa</strong>, who was himself <strong>a character in the story</strong>.<br>
He dictated the entire epic to <strong>Lord Ganesha</strong>, who agreed to write it down <strong>only if Vyasa spoke without pause</strong>.<br>
Vyasa cleverly added <strong>deep meanings and pauses</strong> that made even Ganesha think!</p>
<hr>
<h2>🕯️ Why Is It Still Relevant?</h2>
<p>Because it talks about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family problems</li>
<li>Jealousy</li>
<li>Honor</li>
<li>Duty</li>
<li>Love</li>
<li>War</li>
<li>Forgiveness</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: <strong>everything a human can feel or face</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether you're a student, warrior, monk, mother, king, or ordinary person — the Mahabharata has something for you.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧠 Thought to Ponder:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is told here is found elsewhere.<br>
What is not told here is found nowhere else.”<br>
— <em>Mahabharata, Adi Parva</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>In the next chapter, we’ll meet Sage Vyasa — the brilliant mind who created this divine tale.</em></p>
