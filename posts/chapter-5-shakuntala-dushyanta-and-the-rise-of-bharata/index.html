      <h1>Chapter 5: Shakuntala, Dushyanta, and the Rise of Bharata</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-23</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In the lineage of the lunar dynasty, after several generations, there was a powerful and noble king named <strong>Dushyanta</strong>. One day, while on a hunting expedition, he entered the hermitage of the great Sage <strong>Kanva</strong>, nestled deep in the forest. There, he met a beautiful young woman named <strong>Shakuntala</strong>, the foster daughter of the sage.</p>
<h3>The Love of Dushyanta and Shakuntala</h3>
<p>Shakuntala was the daughter of <strong>Sage Vishwamitra</strong> and <strong>Menaka</strong>, the celestial nymph. Menaka had left the infant Shakuntala in the care of Sage Kanva after her birth. As Shakuntala grew up in the peaceful ashram, she became wise, graceful, and radiant.</p>
<p>King Dushyanta was instantly captivated by her. They fell in love, and following the <strong>Gandharva marriage</strong> tradition (a marriage of mutual consent without rituals), they got married in secret. Dushyanta gave her his royal ring as a token and promise that he would send for her soon to take her to his palace.</p>
<h3>The Curse of Sage Durvasa</h3>
<p>Some time after Dushyanta left, the fiery Sage <strong>Durvasa</strong> visited the hermitage. Shakuntala, lost in thoughts of her husband, failed to greet him with proper respect. Enraged, Durvasa cursed her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He whom you are thinking about will forget you!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other sages begged for mercy, and Durvasa softened the curse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIf you show him a token he gave you, he will remember everything.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Dushyanta's Forgetfulness</h3>
<p>Shakuntala later set out to the king‚Äôs palace, but on the journey, she accidentally dropped the ring into a river. When she arrived at the court, Dushyanta did not recognize her due to the curse, and without the ring as proof, she was heartbroken. She left the palace and gave birth to a son in the forest.</p>
<h3>The Birth of Bharata</h3>
<p>Her son was named <strong>Bharata</strong>. Even as a child, Bharata was fearless. He would play with wild animals, opening the mouths of tigers and lions with his bare hands. He showed incredible strength and courage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a fisherman found the royal ring in a fish‚Äôs belly and brought it to the palace. Upon seeing the ring, Dushyanta‚Äôs memory returned instantly. Filled with remorse, he rushed to find Shakuntala and welcomed both her and his son back with honor and love.</p>
<h3>Bharata the Great</h3>
<p>Bharata grew to become a legendary emperor who conquered vast lands and united the kingdom. He was the <strong>first true emperor of India</strong>, ruling with justice and valor.</p>
<p>The land came to be known as <strong>Bharatavarsha</strong>, the <strong>land of Bharata</strong>, in his honor ‚Äî and it still bears his name to this day.</p>
