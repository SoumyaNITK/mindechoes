      <h1>Chapter 2 - Shantanu and Ganga: A Mysterious Marriage</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-19</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Generations after Yayati, there was born a noble and just king named <strong>Shantanu</strong>, a direct descendant of the mighty Puru.</p>
<h2>🏞️ The Encounter at the River</h2>
<p>One day, while strolling along the banks of the sacred <strong>Ganga</strong>, King Shantanu beheld a stunningly beautiful woman. She was none other than <strong>Goddess Ganga</strong> in human form.</p>
<p>Without revealing her divine nature, she agreed to marry him—but with one strange condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You must never question or stop me from doing anything, no matter how strange it may seem. If you do, I will leave you.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blinded by love, Shantanu agreed.</p>
<h2>👶 The Drowned Children</h2>
<p>Over time, Ganga bore <strong>seven sons</strong>. But each time, as soon as the child was born, she would take the newborn and <strong>drown it</strong> in the river.</p>
<p>Shantanu, heartbroken, could say nothing—he was bound by his promise. He watched silently, hoping the next child would be spared.</p>
<h2>🚫 The Promise is Broken</h2>
<p>When the <strong>eighth child</strong> was born, Ganga again walked toward the river. But this time, Shantanu couldn’t bear it any longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Stop! Why are you doing this? What kind of mother drowns her own children?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ganga stopped. She smiled gently and said, <em>“You have broken your promise. Now I must leave.”</em></p>
<p>She then revealed her true identity: <strong>a celestial being</strong> sent to Earth with a divine purpose.</p>
<h3>👼 The Secret of the Eight Children</h3>
<p>Ganga explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>The eight children were the <strong>eight Vasus</strong>, heavenly beings cursed to be born on Earth.</li>
<li>She was releasing them from their mortal lives by drowning them at birth.</li>
<li>The <strong>eighth child</strong>, however, was cursed to live a long life on Earth—this child was <strong>Devavrata</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>👦 Devavrata: The Son Who Stayed</h2>
<p>Ganga took Devavrata away with her to be raised in the heavens by divine sages and trained in every art, science, and weaponry.</p>
<p>Years later, she would return the boy—now a powerful, wise, and radiant young man—to his father, King Shantanu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This boy would grow to become <strong>Bhishma</strong>, one of the greatest heroes in Indian mythology.</p>
