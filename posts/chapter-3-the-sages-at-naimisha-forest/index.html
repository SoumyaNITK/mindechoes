      <h1>Chapter 3: The Sages at Naimisha Forest</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-21</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>After Sage Vyasa composed the <strong>Mahabharata</strong>, he taught it to his disciples.<br>
One of his chief students, <strong>Vaishampayana</strong>, memorized the entire epic with devotion and clarity.</p>
<p>Now the question was:<br>
<strong>Who would listen to this great story?</strong><br>
Who would carry it forward for generations to come?</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌳 The Sacred Forest of Naimisha</h2>
<p>Far from cities and noise, there was a holy forest called <strong>Naimisharanya</strong>.<br>
It was a peaceful, divine place where <strong>great sages gathered for long spiritual rituals</strong> called <strong>yajnas</strong>.</p>
<p>These sages were led by <strong>Shaunaka Rishi</strong>, a wise and respected elder.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔥 The 12-Year Yajna</h2>
<p>Shaunaka and thousands of rishis were performing a <strong>12-year-long fire sacrifice</strong> (yajna) to bring peace and wisdom to the world.<br>
It was during this ritual that a storyteller named <strong>Ugrashrava Sauti</strong> arrived.</p>
<p>Sauti was the <strong>son of Lomaharshana</strong>, a disciple of Vyasa.<br>
He was known as a great narrator who had travelled far and wide, collecting <strong>stories, Puranas, and knowledge from sages</strong> across India.</p>
<p>When the sages saw him, they welcomed him with love and respect.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🙏 Request to Hear the Mahabharata</h2>
<p>Shaunaka Rishi said to Sauti:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“O learned one, you know many sacred stories.<br>
Tell us about the great Mahabharata — the story of truth, war, love, and dharma.<br>
Begin from the beginning, and tell us <strong>everything, without missing a single detail.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sauti bowed to them and agreed.<br>
He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What I know was told by <strong>Vaishampayana</strong>, who learned it from <strong>Vyasa himself</strong>.<br>
I will now tell you this divine story, as I heard it — <strong>complete and sacred.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>🎤 How the Epic Was Passed Down</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vyasa → Vaishampayana → King Janamejaya</strong> (in a royal court)</li>
<li><strong>Sauti heard it from Vaishampayana</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sauti now tells it to the sages at Naimisha Forest</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the chain of truth — an <strong>oral lineage of knowledge</strong>, passed with precision and love.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧠 Thought to Ponder:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Stories live not on paper, but in the hearts of those who listen with devotion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the next chapter, we dive into the <strong>story of King Bharata</strong>, the noble ancestor after whom <strong>India itself is named</strong>.</p>
