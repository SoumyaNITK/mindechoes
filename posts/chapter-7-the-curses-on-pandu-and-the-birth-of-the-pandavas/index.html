      <h1>Chapter 7 - The Curses on Pandu and the Birth of the Pandavas</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-24</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With Pandu crowned king of Hastinapura, the kingdom flourished under his wise and disciplined rule. He brought many regions under his command and earned the admiration of the people. Dhritarashtra, though the eldest, remained out of succession due to his blindness, while Vidura continued to be the kingdom's conscience.</p>
<h2>Pandu's Marriage and a Fateful Curse</h2>
<p>Pandu married two princesses—<strong>Kunti</strong>, the daughter of King Kuntibhoja, and <strong>Madri</strong>, the princess of Madra. His life seemed perfect until one tragic day during a hunting expedition in the forest.</p>
<p>While hunting, Pandu spotted a pair of deer in a mating posture. Without hesitation, he shot his arrows and struck them both. But these weren’t ordinary deer—<strong>they were a sage named Kindama and his wife</strong>, who had taken the form of animals for privacy. As the sage lay dying, he cursed Pandu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since you killed us in a moment of intimacy, may you die the instant you approach your wife with desire!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This curse shattered Pandu’s spirit. Filled with guilt, he decided to <strong>renounce his throne and live in the forest</strong> as a hermit. Kunti and Madri, loyal to him, accompanied him into exile. The throne was entrusted to Dhritarashtra, with Bhishma and Vidura guiding him.</p>
<h2>The Secret of Kunti's Boon</h2>
<p>Long before her marriage, Kunti had served the sage Durvasa with great devotion. Impressed, the sage had granted her a secret mantra—a boon that allowed her to <strong>invoke any god and have a child by them</strong>, without any physical union. Pandu, longing for children but restrained by the curse, reminded her of this boon.</p>
<h2>The Divine Births</h2>
<p>With Pandu’s blessing, Kunti invoked the gods one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yama (God of Dharma)</strong> blessed her with <strong>Yudhishthira</strong>, calm, wise, and just.</li>
<li><strong>Vayu (Wind God)</strong> gave her <strong>Bhima</strong>, born with incredible strength.</li>
<li><strong>Indra (King of the Gods)</strong> gave her <strong>Arjuna</strong>, destined to be the greatest archer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, Kunti shared the mantra with Madri. She invoked the <strong>Ashwini twins</strong>, divine horsemen, and bore <strong>Nakula</strong> and <strong>Sahadeva</strong>, known for their beauty and intelligence.</p>
<p>These five divine sons were raised in the forest, away from the palace, but their virtues and powers already hinted at greatness. They came to be known as the <strong>Pandavas</strong>—the sons of Pandu.</p>
<h2>The Tragedy of Pandu</h2>
<p>Despite years of discipline, Pandu was one day overcome by desire. Forgetting the curse, he approached Madri with affection. The moment he touched her, <strong>he collapsed and died</strong>—the curse had taken its toll.</p>
<p>Madri was devastated. Holding herself responsible, she chose to <strong>sacrifice her life on Pandu’s funeral pyre</strong>, entrusting her sons to Kunti’s care. Now a widow with five children, Kunti returned to Hastinapura.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Pandavas would change the course of history. While the kingdom welcomed them, their presence stirred envy in the hearts of others—especially in Duryodhana, the eldest son of Dhritarashtra.</p>
<p>The seeds of rivalry were about to take root.</p>
