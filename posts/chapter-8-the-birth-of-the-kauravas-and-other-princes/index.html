        <p>While Pandu and Kunti were living in the forest, celebrating the miraculous births of their sons through the blessings of various deities, back in the kingdom of Hastinapura, Gandhari too was expecting a child ‚Äî or so everyone thought.</p>
<h2>Gandhari‚Äôs Strange Pregnancy</h2>
<p>When Gandhari heard that Kunti had already given birth to a child ‚Äî Yudhishthira ‚Äî she was filled with jealousy and frustration. After all, she was the queen! She had been pregnant for nearly <strong>two years</strong>, but there was no sign of delivery.</p>
<p>One night, unable to bear the mental anguish, Gandhari struck her own womb in rage. The result was devastating ‚Äî <strong>a hard mass of lifeless flesh</strong> emerged from her body.</p>
<p>Heartbroken and unsure of what to do, Gandhari turned to <strong>Vyasa</strong>, the great sage who had earlier granted her the boon of a hundred sons. She pleaded with him for help.</p>
<h2>Vyasa‚Äôs Intervention and the Clay Pots</h2>
<p>Vyasa, using his divine knowledge and power, <strong>cut the lump into 100 equal pieces</strong>, and placed them each in <strong>jars filled with ghee</strong> (clarified butter). He also prepared <strong>one extra jar</strong> for a daughter.</p>
<p>He told Gandhari to <strong>keep the jars in a concealed place</strong> and wait patiently for the divine process to complete. Eventually, after some time, from these jars emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100 sons</strong>, the eldest being <strong>Duryodhana</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 daughter</strong>, named <strong>Duhsala</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Ominous Birth of Duryodhana</h2>
<p>On the day Duryodhana was born, ominous events occurred in Hastinapura:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wild animals howled eerily</li>
<li>Donkeys brayed in distress</li>
<li>The sky grew dark and cloudy, although it wasn‚Äôt the rainy season</li>
</ul>
<p>When learned astrologers and sages came to see the newborn, they warned <strong>King Dhritarashtra</strong> that this child would bring ruin to the royal family. They even advised abandoning the child immediately for the sake of the kingdom.</p>
<p>But Dhritarashtra, like many fathers, ignored their warning and let his affection win.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thus, the seed of conflict was sown even at birth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Other Princes</h2>
<p>Over time, Gandhari‚Äôs other sons were born from the jars. Some of the notable among the 100 Kaurava brothers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dushasana</strong>, the second eldest</li>
<li><strong>Vikarna</strong>, known for his sense of justice</li>
<li><strong>Chitrasena</strong>, <strong>Durmukha</strong>, and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, <strong>Madri</strong>, Pandu‚Äôs second wife, gave birth to <strong>Nakula</strong> and <strong>Sahadeva</strong> with the blessings of the <strong>Ashwini Kumaras</strong>, the twin gods of medicine.</p>
<p>Thus, the five Pandavas were born:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Yudhishthira</strong> (from Yama)</li>
<li><strong>Bhima</strong> (from Vayu)</li>
<li><strong>Arjuna</strong> (from Indra)</li>
<li><strong>Nakula</strong> (from Ashwini Kumara 1)</li>
<li><strong>Sahadeva</strong> (from Ashwini Kumara 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>These children were <strong>born of divine blessings</strong>, while the Kauravas were born through an <strong>unnatural process</strong> ‚Äî a symbolic contrast that would echo throughout their lives.</p>
<h2>Childhood at Hastinapura</h2>
<p>Eventually, the young princes ‚Äî both Pandavas and Kauravas ‚Äî began to grow up together in the royal palace of Hastinapura.</p>
<p>Their upbringing, education, and the early signs of rivalry are the next important parts of this vast epic.</p>
