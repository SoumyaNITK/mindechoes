      <div class="content">
        <p>In my first semester of college, we had to give a seminar as part of our internal assessment. It was my first time standing in front of my classmates and a professor to explain something I had prepared. I was nervous but hopeful. I had watched a lecture on YouTube and noted down what I thought were good points. I practiced, revised, and tried to feel ready.</p>
<p>Only one professor was in the room — he wasn’t our subject teacher, but the seminar evaluator. His job was to watch and grade us.</p>
<p>I gave my presentation. It wasn’t perfect. My English wasn’t great. But I tried to speak with as much confidence as I could gather.</p>
<p>At the very end, the professor looked at me and asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Do you think you have explained it well?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I answered honestly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I think I did a good job.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one sentence changed everything.</p>
<p>He suddenly became angry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are arrogant,” he said. “I can write in papers that you can’t do anything in your life with such attitude.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There was a student named Pritesh, he’s from UP. His English was also not perfect, but at least he wasn’t as arrogant as you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he stared at me.</p>
<p>Not for a few seconds — for almost a full minute.</p>
<p>I froze. I didn’t know what to do. I glanced at my classmates for a second, just trying to avoid that intense stare — but he was still looking straight at me. So I had to look back.</p>
<p><strong>That silence was louder than any scolding.</strong></p>
<p>After the seminar, I walked back to my room without saying anything. I didn’t eat that evening. I missed snacks, skipped dinner, and couldn’t even lie down properly. I kept thinking about every word. My chest felt tight.</p>
<p>Between 11 PM and 5 AM, I vomited 2-3 times. I had a fever. I didn’t sleep even for a minute.</p>
<p>The next morning, the fever came down slightly. I went to class. But I couldn’t look anyone in the eye out of embarrassment. I felt like I had been erased.</p>
<p>Before that day, I had a small routine that gave me happiness. I used to play table tennis with my friends almost daily. I had even bought my own TT kit. I was improving, enjoying it — and honestly, it was one of the few things that made me feel light and relaxed.</p>
<p>But after that seminar day, I never went back to the TT room. I couldn’t.</p>
<p>I don’t even know where my TT kit is now. It’s just... gone.</p>
<p>Once, in the second semester, I tried playing again. Just for a few minutes. But I had lost the touch. I was fumbling simple serves and couldn’t return basic shots. The rhythm was gone. And with it, so was the joy.</p>
<p>I don’t know if he remembers me — but I remember every word he said. Still, I also know something else: <strong>I’m not the same student anymore.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not trying to prove anything to that professor — or to anyone. I’m just trying to become better.</p>
<p>I still respect that professor.</p>
<p>Maybe he was strict to make us understand something bigger. Maybe he saw my words differently than I meant them. Maybe I truly looked arrogant that day, even if I didn’t feel it.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t carry anger. I carry the lesson.</strong></p>
