Hi again.

So, Day 1. Not a perfect day, but a start â€” and thatâ€™s what matters right now.

I woke up around 7:30 AM, started my morning with an hour of coding. Felt good to warm up the brain. Then came the usual â€” brushing, breakfast, and a little bit of chill time.

From 11 AM to 1 PM, I focused on Electrodynamics. It wasnâ€™t too heavy, but I tried to stay focused. After that, I took a bath, had lunch, and then picked up Electrodynamics again from 2:30 PM to 3:45 PM. A solid second session.

Evening came, and I let myself relax a bit till around 6:15 PM. Just small breaks in between to breathe and not overdo it.

Itâ€™s not about being super strict from Day 1 â€” itâ€™s about getting into rhythm, slowly but surely. The goal is to be consistent, not perfect.

Letâ€™s see how the rest of the day goes. One day at a time.

â€” Gudu ðŸŒ±
