        <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>So, Day 1. Not a perfect day, but a start — and that’s what matters right now.</p>
<p>I woke up around 7:30 AM, started my morning with an hour of coding. Felt good to warm up the brain. Then came the usual — brushing, breakfast, and a little bit of chill time.</p>
<p>From 11 AM to 1 PM, I focused on Electrodynamics. It wasn’t too heavy, but I tried to stay focused. After that, I took a bath, had lunch, and then picked up Electrodynamics again from 2:30 PM to 3:45 PM. A solid second session.</p>
<p>Evening came, and I let myself relax a bit till around 6:15 PM. Just small breaks in between to breathe and not overdo it.</p>
<p>It’s not about being super strict from Day 1 — it’s about getting into rhythm, slowly but surely. The goal is to be consistent, not perfect.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the rest of the day goes. One day at a time.</p>
