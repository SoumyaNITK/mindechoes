        <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>So, Day 1. Not perfect, not intense — but steady. And that’s a good beginning.</p>
<p>I woke up around 7:30 AM and started the day with an hour of coding. It felt good to get the mind moving early. After that, I did the usual morning routine — brushed, had breakfast, and relaxed for a bit.</p>
<p>From 11 AM to 1 PM, I studied Electrodynamics. Took it slow, tried to stay focused. Then I had a bath and lunch. Picked up the books again from 2:30 PM to 3:45 PM for another Electrodynamics session. It wasn’t too long, but enough to feel like progress.</p>
<p>Evening came with some chill time till around 6:15 PM. After that, I went to a neighbor boy’s birthday party. Just a short break from the study zone.</p>
<p>By 7:45 PM, I was back at the desk, this time with Solid State Physics. Studied till 9 PM — not bad for an evening session. Then I watched some sports till 9:40 PM, had dinner, and spent a bit of time scrolling on my phone (yeah, I know 😅).</p>
<p>Now it’s 11:30 PM, and I’m heading to sleep. Tired, but happy that I started. It’s not about doing everything at once — it’s about showing up.</p>
<p>Let’s keep this going, one day at a time.</p>
<p>— Gudu 🌙</p>
