<h2><strong>Satyavati Becomes Queen</strong></h2>
<p>After Prince Devavrata (later known as <strong>Bhishma</strong>) took his terrible vow of lifelong celibacy and loyalty to ensure her marriage, <strong>Satyavati</strong>, the daughter of a fisherman, finally became <strong>Queen of Hastinapura</strong>.</p>
<p>She was once a humble ferryman’s daughter, but her destiny had always aimed higher. Unknown to most, she had a mystical past — she had earlier borne a son, <strong>Vyasa</strong>, through the sage <strong>Parashara</strong>, a secret she kept hidden even after marrying Shantanu.</p>
<p>With Bhishma’s vow ensuring no challenge from his side, the future of the Kuru dynasty now rested solely on the children born to Shantanu and Satyavati.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Birth of Two Princes</strong></h2>
<p>Satyavati and King Shantanu had two sons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chitrangada</strong> – Strong, ambitious, and named after a celestial Gandharva.</li>
<li><strong>Vichitravirya</strong> – Younger, less physically robust, but gentle and kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the death of Shantanu, <strong>Chitrangada</strong> became king.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Tragic Fate of Chitrangada</strong></h2>
<p>Chitrangada’s reign didn’t last long.</p>
<p>The celestial <strong>Gandharva Chitrangada</strong>, offended that a mere mortal shared his name and fame, challenged him to battle.</p>
<p>The two warriors fought for many years in a clash of ego and power. In the end, the Gandharva triumphed.</p>
<p><strong>Chitrangada was killed</strong>, leaving Hastinapura without a ruling king.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Bhishma’s Guardianship</strong></h2>
<p>With the throne vacant, <strong>Bhishma</strong>, ever loyal, stepped in once again.</p>
<p>He did not claim the throne — true to his vow — but ruled as <strong>regent</strong>, overseeing the kingdom while preparing <strong>Vichitravirya</strong>, still a child, to eventually take over.</p>
<p>Bhishma guided the court with wisdom, strength, and unflinching commitment, while Satyavati focused on securing her family's legacy.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Marriage for Vichitravirya</strong></h2>
<p>As Vichitravirya reached adulthood, Satyavati insisted he be married to strengthen his rule.</p>
<p>The perfect opportunity arose — a <strong>Swayamvara</strong> (self-choice ceremony) was being held by the <strong>King of Kashi</strong> for his three daughters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amba</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ambika</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ambalika</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>But the king had <strong>not invited Hastinapura</strong>, as he wanted no alliance with them — a grave insult to the Kuru throne.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Bhishma’s Bold Act</strong></h2>
<p>In a dramatic and powerful move, <strong>Bhishma rode alone</strong> into the swayamvara, <strong>defeated all other suitors</strong>, and <strong>abducted all three princesses</strong> on behalf of Vichitravirya — a common practice in the era.</p>
<p>This bold act shocked many, but no one dared to fight him after seeing his skill and righteousness.</p>
<p>The girls were brought back to Hastinapura. However, fate had another twist waiting, particularly with the eldest daughter, <strong>Amba</strong>...</p>
