        <p>Hey again.</p>
<p>It’s 8:30 PM right now. The world outside is doing its usual thing — lights flickering on, people winding down, maybe scrolling through endless reels. But here I am, choosing something different.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of a new chapter: my CSIR-NET prep journey. The exam could be on any day between 26th and 28th July, and that window feels both close and far at the same time. Like a wave on the horizon — you know it’s coming, but you can’t quite feel it yet.</p>
<p>This post isn’t meant to be grand. It’s just a marker. A quiet click in the timeline of my life that says, “This is when I started accelerating.”</p>
<p>I’m not chasing perfection — just progress. One day at a time. One concept at a time. Some days will feel powerful, others might feel like mud. That’s okay. I’ll keep showing up.</p>
<p>From now on, this blog will be my prep companion. My digital accountability partner. My cheerleader on the days when motivation hides under the bed.</p>
<p>So, dear future me — if you’re reading this after the exam, I hope you’re proud. Not just of the result, but of the fact that you gave it your all. That you started.</p>
<p>More updates soon. This is just the ignition.</p>
<p>Let’s keep going.</p>
