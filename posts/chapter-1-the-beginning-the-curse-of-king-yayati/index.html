      <h1>Chapter 1 - The Beginning: The Curse of King Yayati</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-18</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Long before the Pandavas and Kauravas were even born, the story of the Mahabharata had already begun, unfolding through generations of kings, curses, and divine interventions. The roots of this epic trace back to a powerful and ambitious king named <strong>Yayati</strong>, whose decisions would shape the destiny of his descendants.</p>
<hr>
<h2>👑 King Yayati and His Lineage</h2>
<p>Yayati was a powerful king from the <strong>Lunar Dynasty (Chandravansha)</strong>. He was the son of <strong>King Nahusha</strong>, who once ruled the heavens in place of Indra. However, due to arrogance and a curse, Nahusha lost his place and became a serpent, passing the throne to Yayati.</p>
<p>Yayati was known for his might, wisdom, and ambition. He had two wives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Devayani</strong> – the daughter of the sage <strong>Shukracharya</strong>, the guru of the Asuras.</li>
<li><strong>Sharmishtha</strong> – a princess of the Danavas (a clan of Asuras), who became Devayani’s maid but eventually also became Yayati’s wife.</li>
</ol>
<p>This triangle was not just romantic—it became <strong>the seed of divine drama</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>😡 The Curse of Devayani’s Father</h2>
<p>Devayani deeply loved Yayati and was possessive. When she discovered that her husband Yayati also had children with her maid-turned-co-wife <strong>Sharmishtha</strong>, she was furious.</p>
<p>Her father, <strong>Shukracharya</strong>, was not just any sage—he was a <strong>master of knowledge, curses, and boons</strong>. When Devayani complained to him, Shukracharya cursed King Yayati:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You, who could not control your desires, shall now become old and weak before your time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, <strong>Yayati instantly turned into an old man</strong>, with grey hair, wrinkled skin, and all the signs of age.</p>
<p>But Yayati wasn’t ready to give up his desires. He begged for forgiveness, saying he had not lived his youth and still had duties to perform.</p>
<p>Shukracharya, though strict, relented a little and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You may exchange your old age with any of your sons who agrees.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>👨‍👦 Yayati’s Sons and the Burden of Desire</h2>
<p>Yayati had five sons from Devayani and Sharmishtha:</p>
<ul>
<li>From <strong>Devayani</strong>: Yadu and Turvasu</li>
<li>From <strong>Sharmishtha</strong>: Druhyu, Anu, and Puru</li>
</ul>
<p>Yayati went to each son and asked them to <strong>take his old age in exchange for youth</strong>, so he could continue enjoying worldly pleasures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yadu and Turvasu refused – they did not want to give up their youth.</li>
<li>Druhyu and Anu also said no.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the youngest son, <strong>Puru</strong>, the son of Sharmishtha, humbly agreed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said, “Father, your desire is my duty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Puru became old, and Yayati got his youth back. For <strong>a thousand years</strong>, Yayati lived in pleasure, fulfilling all his desires.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, <strong>he became tired</strong>. He realized that desire never ends—it only grows stronger. He gave back the youth to Puru and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one has ever satisfied desire by indulging in it. It only grows, like a fire fed with ghee.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>👑 The Throne to Puru</h2>
<p>In gratitude and admiration, Yayati made <strong>Puru his heir</strong>, despite him being the youngest. This act formed the line of kings that would eventually lead to <strong>King Bharata</strong>, and much later, the <strong>Kurus</strong>, including <strong>Pandavas and Kauravas</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yadu, though the eldest, was denied the throne. But he later became the ancestor of <strong>the Yadavas</strong>, including <strong>Krishna</strong>.</li>
<li>Puru became the rightful head of the dynasty—<strong>the ancestor of the Kauravas and Pandavas</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🌱 The Seed of the Epic</h2>
<p>This story, seemingly small, carries the <strong>core themes of Mahabharata</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desire vs Duty</li>
<li>Sacrifice and Dharma</li>
<li>The consequences of choices across generations</li>
</ul>
<p>From Yayati’s curse to Puru’s sacrifice, the wheels of fate began turning. The <strong>epic of Mahabharata</strong> was slowly coming to life.</p>
