      <h1>Chapter 9 - The Gurukul Days: Drona and the Training of Princes</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>After the Pandavas and Kauravas grew into their youth, it was time for their education and martial training. The Kuru elders decided to appoint a competent teacher who could guide the princes in the arts of war and dharma.</p>
<h2>Drona‚Äôs Arrival in Hastinapura</h2>
<p>Drona, a renowned Brahmin and a skilled warrior, arrived in Hastinapura in humble clothes. His reputation as a master of military arts preceded him. Though born a Brahmin, Drona had unparalleled knowledge of weaponry. He sought employment from King Drupada of Panchala, his childhood friend, but was insulted and turned away. Drona, humiliated and seeking means to support his family, arrived at Hastinapura.</p>
<p>Bhishma recognized Drona's potential and appointed him as the royal guru to train the Kuru princes.</p>
<h2>The Training Begins</h2>
<p>Under Drona‚Äôs strict guidance, the princes learned archery, swordsmanship, mace fighting, and warfare strategy. Drona had one condition before beginning: the princes must promise to assist him in a future mission ‚Äî a promise they accepted.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arjuna</strong>, among all, quickly emerged as the most dedicated and skilled. He practiced at night in secret and earned Drona‚Äôs admiration.</li>
<li><strong>Bhima</strong> specialized in strength-based combat and mace fighting.</li>
<li><strong>Yudhishthira</strong> excelled in spear and chariot warfare and was known for his honesty and calm mind.</li>
<li><strong>Nakula and Sahadeva</strong> learned swordsmanship and horse training with great finesse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the Kauravas, <strong>Duryodhana</strong> and <strong>Dushasana</strong> were strong but arrogant, often provoking the Pandavas.</p>
<h2>Ekalavya‚Äôs Story: The Silent Disciple</h2>
<p>One day, the Pandavas found a boy named <strong>Ekalavya</strong>, practicing archery in the forest with great skill. He had crafted a clay idol of Drona and considered him his guru. When Drona discovered this, he feared Ekalavya‚Äôs growing prowess might surpass Arjuna.</p>
<p>To ensure Arjuna remained the best, Drona asked Ekalavya for <strong>guru dakshina (teacher‚Äôs fee)</strong>. The price? Ekalavya‚Äôs right thumb. Without hesitation, Ekalavya cut it off and offered it. Though tragic, this story remains a powerful example of dedication and the rigid structure of social hierarchy in ancient times.</p>
<h2>Arjuna: Drona‚Äôs Favorite</h2>
<p>Drona, impressed by Arjuna‚Äôs loyalty and skill, declared him his most beloved student. He taught Arjuna secret techniques and blessed him to become the greatest archer of his time.</p>
<p>To further prove Arjuna‚Äôs excellence, Drona organized a display of martial skills before the royal court. Arjuna amazed everyone with his unmatched archery. However, in this event, another warrior appeared ‚Äî <strong>Karna</strong>.</p>
<h2>Karna‚Äôs Entry and Duryodhana‚Äôs Support</h2>
<p>Karna, a young man of great confidence and skill, challenged Arjuna. But when asked to reveal his lineage, Karna was mocked for being a charioteer‚Äôs son and not of royal blood.</p>
<p>Duryodhana, sensing a powerful ally, immediately crowned Karna as king of Anga. This act cemented a deep bond between Duryodhana and Karna ‚Äî one born of mutual respect and rivalry with the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Thus, even during training, seeds of future enmity were being sown.</p>
<h2>Drona‚Äôs Revenge on Drupada</h2>
<p>Having trained the princes, Drona now asked for his promised dakshina ‚Äî to capture King Drupada. He sent the Kauravas, who failed. Then he sent the Pandavas, led by Arjuna. They defeated Drupada and brought him to Drona.</p>
<p>But Drona, though victorious, did not seek revenge like a tyrant. He divided Drupada‚Äôs kingdom into two ‚Äî keeping one half for himself and giving the other half back to Drupada.</p>
<p>This act fulfilled his promise while also showing Drona‚Äôs unique mix of pride, strategy, and fairness.</p>
<hr>
<p>From these early days of training, loyalties were formed, rivalries took root, and each prince‚Äôs destiny began to unfold.</p>
