Hey again.

It’s 8:30 PM right now. The world outside is doing its usual thing — lights flickering on, people winding down, maybe scrolling through endless reels. But here I am, choosing something different.

Today marks the beginning of a new chapter: my CSIR-NET prep journey. The exam could be on any day between 26th and 28th July, and that window feels both close and far at the same time. Like a wave on the horizon — you know it’s coming, but you can’t quite feel it yet.

This post isn’t meant to be grand. It’s just a marker. A quiet click in the timeline of my life that says, “This is when I started accelerating.”

I’m not chasing perfection — just progress. One day at a time. One concept at a time. Some days will feel powerful, others might feel like mud. That’s okay. I’ll keep showing up.

From now on, this blog will be my prep companion. My digital accountability partner. My cheerleader on the days when motivation hides under the bed.

So, dear future me — if you’re reading this after the exam, I hope you’re proud. Not just of the result, but of the fact that you gave it your all. That you started.

More updates soon. This is just the ignition.

Let’s keep going.

— Gudu 🚀
