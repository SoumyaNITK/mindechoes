      <h1>Chapter 4: King Bharata&#39;s Story</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-22</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Bharata was the son of <strong>King Dushyanta</strong> and <strong>Shakuntala</strong>, and he would become one of the greatest emperors of ancient India. His name would live on forever — so much so that India itself would come to be known as <strong>“Bharat.”</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>👑 Childhood and Destiny</h2>
<p>Born in the forest hermitage of Sage Kanva, Bharata was raised in a simple, disciplined environment. Though his father Dushyanta initially forgot Shakuntala due to a curse, he later remembered and brought her and Bharata back to the palace.</p>
<p>Even as a boy, Bharata showed signs of greatness. Wild animals that feared everyone else would approach him calmly. He was fearless and wise beyond his years.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌍 Rule of Righteousness</h2>
<p>When Bharata became king, he conquered vast territories through <strong>peace, dharma, and power</strong>. He performed many <strong>Ashwamedha Yagnas</strong> (horse sacrifices) to demonstrate his sovereignty and purified his soul through these rituals.</p>
<p>He was a just and noble king, loved by all his people. His name became a symbol of ideal kingship.</p>
<hr>
<h2>❌ Rejection of His Sons</h2>
<p>Though Bharata had many sons, he found none of them worthy of the throne. They were either greedy, foolish, or too soft-hearted to lead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A king must not follow the law of attachment,” Bharata declared.<br>
“He must serve the law of righteousness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a bold move, he <strong>rejected his own sons</strong> and chose a young boy named <strong>Bhumanyu</strong>, who had been born through the blessings of sages, to carry on his lineage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧬 The Bharata Dynasty</h2>
<p>Bharata's choice set the tone for generations to come. The <strong>Bharata dynasty</strong> became one of the greatest in history, leading eventually to <strong>King Kuru</strong>, then to <strong>Shantanu</strong>, and ultimately to the <strong>Pandavas and Kauravas</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mahabharata is called so because it is the tale of this mighty lineage — the <strong>“descendants of Bharata.”</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>✨ Legacy</h2>
<ul>
<li>India is called <strong>Bharat</strong> in honor of this great king.</li>
<li>He proved that <strong>righteousness &gt; bloodline</strong>.</li>
<li>His rule laid the <strong>moral foundation</strong> for all future kings in the epic.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“The worth of a man is not in his birth, but in his dharma.”<br>
— The lesson of King Bharata</p>
