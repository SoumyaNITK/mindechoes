      <h1>Chapter 3 - Bhishma’s Terrible Vow</h1>
      <p class="date">2025-07-20</p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>After Ganga left King Shantanu, taking their last-born son with her, years passed.</p>
<p>But Shantanu couldn’t forget her. He kept ruling the kingdom of Hastinapur, but his heart had a silent ache. There was no queen by his side, and his heir was missing.</p>
<p>One day, while walking near the Ganga river, Shantanu felt something unusual.</p>
<h2>A Strange Sight in the River</h2>
<p>He saw the river flowing in a strange way — as if someone was controlling it. The flow of the water was being blocked and diverted with such skill that the riverbed appeared neat and calm.</p>
<p>Surprised, he followed the water’s path and discovered a handsome young man, shooting arrows that dammed the river.</p>
<p>Shantanu was amazed. This wasn’t any ordinary youth. He moved with elegance and authority. His skills with the bow were divine.</p>
<p>Then, like a flash of memory, Shantanu realized — this was <em>his</em> son. The last child Ganga had taken away.</p>
<p>Just then, the river rippled... and from it appeared Ganga herself, in her celestial form.</p>
<h2>The Reunion with Ganga</h2>
<p>Ganga smiled at Shantanu and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is your son, Devavrata. I have raised him in the heavens under the guidance of great sages like Vasishtha and Brihaspati. He is trained in the Vedas, archery, statesmanship, and more. Now, he is ready to be by your side.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shantanu was overwhelmed with joy. Finally, his heir was here — powerful, wise, and ready.</p>
<p>Devavrata bowed to his father with respect, and Shantanu brought him back to Hastinapur, announcing him as the prince and heir to the throne.</p>
<p>The people celebrated. The future looked bright.</p>
<h2>A New Woman Enters the Story</h2>
<p>Time passed, and one day, while walking along the banks of the Yamuna river, Shantanu saw a woman unlike any he had seen.</p>
<p>She was beautiful, calm, and radiated a sense of grace. She was Satyavati — daughter of a fisherman chief. She helped people cross the river on her boat.</p>
<p>Shantanu was drawn to her. He visited her home and asked her father for her hand in marriage.</p>
<p>But the fisherman had a condition.</p>
<h2>The Fisherman’s Bold Demand</h2>
<p>The fisherman said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If my daughter marries you, her son must become king. Not Devavrata.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shantanu was shattered. He couldn’t do injustice to Devavrata, who was noble and truly worthy.</p>
<p>So, Shantanu walked away, silently.</p>
<p>He returned to his palace, sad and heartbroken. He didn’t tell anyone the reason for his sorrow, but Devavrata noticed his father’s silence.</p>
<h2>Devavrata's Search for Truth</h2>
<p>Devavrata asked his father’s ministers and advisors. Eventually, he found out about Shantanu’s meeting with Satyavati and the condition laid down by her father.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Devavrata went to meet the fisherman.</p>
<p>“I promise,” Devavrata said, “I will never become king. The throne will go to Satyavati’s children.”</p>
<p>Still, the fisherman wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>“What if your children later claim the throne?” he asked.</p>
<p>And then… came a vow that shook the very heavens.</p>
<h2>The Terrible Vow</h2>
<p>Devavrata stood tall and declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I vow to never marry. I will remain a brahmachari — a celibate — for my entire life. I will have no children. Ever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gods above thundered.</p>
<p>The rivers hushed.</p>
<p>The earth trembled in awe.</p>
<p>He had just made the most difficult vow any man could make — and <em>meant</em> it.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Devavrata was no longer just a prince.</p>
<p>He became <strong>Bhishma</strong> — the one who took the terrible vow.</p>
<h2>Shantanu’s Gift</h2>
<p>When Shantanu heard what his son had done, he was deeply moved. His heart ached with love and pride.</p>
<p>He blessed Bhishma with a rare boon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shall have <em>iccha-mrityu</em> — the power to choose the time of your own death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bhishma bowed, humble as ever.</p>
<p>Shantanu then married Satyavati. And from her, the next chapter of the Mahabharata would unfold.</p>
<p>But nothing would ever shine brighter than the sacrifice of Bhishma — a man who gave up everything for his father’s happiness.</p>
