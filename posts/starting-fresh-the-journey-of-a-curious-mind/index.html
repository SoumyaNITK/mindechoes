        <p>Hey, me.</p>
<p>So… here we are. Finally doing this. Not for likes, not for validation, not for anyone else — just for us.</p>
<p>This space isn’t meant to impress. It’s not meant to be perfect. It’s just a place to breathe. To spill out the thoughts that never quite fit in conversations, to say things I’ve always wanted to hear from someone — even if that someone is me.</p>
<p>I don’t know where this is going. And honestly? That’s okay. Not everything needs a roadmap. Sometimes, you just write because your mind feels heavy. Or weirdly light. Or because silence gets too loud inside your head.</p>
<p>This is my journal in the sky — where I whisper my thoughts into the void and let them float. Maybe no one will ever read them. Maybe someday I will. Maybe I’ll laugh at how dramatic I sound, or maybe I’ll be thankful I gave myself this space.</p>
<p>Whatever happens… thank you, me, for showing up.</p>
<p>Let’s talk more often.</p>
<p>— Gudu</p>
